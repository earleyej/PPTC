If the combinations demonstrate therapeutic enhancement, then we may propose expanding the studies to include several Ewing sarcoma xenograft lines, as the COG bone tumor Committee is also interested in entinostat combinations.",1

Hypothesis:  That the novel antimitotic agent, eribulin will have at least an additive interaction with irinotecan in these xenograft models  ",1

"8",264,"general_informatio_arm_3","1610P","Ixazomib","The objectives of this study are to: (1) evaluate the single-agent in vivo efficacy of ixazomib against a panel of T-ALL xenografts [including typical T-ALL and early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL), Table 1]; and, (2) evaluate the in vivo efficacy of ixazomib in combination with methotrexate against T-ALL xenografts.",1
"9",267,"general_informatio_arm_3","1605P","KPT-8602","The objective of this study is to determine if the SINE KPT-8602 will exert significant in vivo efficacy against an extended panel of paediatric cancer xenografts, including ALL, neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma (Table 1). Due to the reported differences in crossing the blood brain barrier, the efficacy of KPT-8602 will also be compared with selinexor, both in combination with radiotherapy (XRT), against 2 orthotopic medulloblastoma xenograft models (Table 1). In addition, combination therapy will be tested to determine whether treatment response can be enhanced when KPT-8602 is combined with established drugs against ALL xenografts. ",1

"12",130,"general_informatio_arm_3","1603P","OT-82","OT-82 will be tested as a single agent against a broad range of pediatric ALL xenografts representative of the following subtypes (n=14) (Table 2): typical B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL, n=3); Ph+-ALL (n=2); Ph-like BCP-ALL (n=3); typical T-ALL (n=3); early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL, n=3). Four Ewing sarcoma xenografts will also be tested against OT-82 as a single agent.",1

"14",273,"general_informatio_arm_3","1622P","TH-3424","TH-3424 is requested for in vivo testing against 6 T-ALL xenograft lines with high AKR1C3 expression levels at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg administered IP once weekly for 3 weeks. In addition, a BCP-ALL xenograft that has been lentivirally transduced to express high levels of AKR1C3 will be included (15). The total planned treatment/observation period will be 12 weeks. Toxicity testing will be performed prior to efficacy testing in non-tumor bearing mice to confirm that the planned dose and schedule are adequately tolerated. If high activity is observed at the 2.5 mg/kg dose, two lines will be selected for dose-response testing (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg).",1
"15",272,"general_informatio_arm_3","1621P","VS-4718 ","The objective of this study is to determine if the synergistic efficacy observed previously between the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 and dasatinib is replicated with the use of the more Abl1-specific TKI imatinib. This will broaden the clinical applicability of incorporating VS-4718 into treatment regimens containing a TKI for Ph+-ALL patients. ",1
"16",263,"general_informatio_arm_3","1620P","VTP-50469","VTP-50469 is requested for in vivo testing against ALL xenograft lines with rearranged KMT2A (MLL) at a dose of 50 mg/kg administered orally twice-daily for 28 days. The total planned treatment/observation period will be 12 weeks. Toxicity testing will be performed prior to efficacy testing in non-tumor bearing mice to confirm that the planned dose and schedule are adequately tolerated. Candidate lines to be tested are listed in Table 3. Initially four lines will be selected for testing to expedite the initiation of testing. After results from these four lines are available, plans for testing the remaining four lines will be finalized.",1
